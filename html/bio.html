			Born in Evanston, Illinois and former resident of Chanhassen, Minnesota and Acton, Massachusetts, Matt spent the majority of his life growing up in the small suburb of Ramsey, New Jersey. In high school, he was a member of the Mock Trial team, the track team, the yearbook staff, and class council.</br></br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			After graduating Ramsey High school as Salutatorian, Matt moved on to study at Tufts University, where he is currently studying Computer Science. When he's not wasting away in front of a computer screen, Matt likes to play Ultimate Frisbee with the Tufts Men's team, as well as drum on trash with Tufts BEATs, a student percussion ensemble that makes music out of trash cans, buckets, and water jugs.
