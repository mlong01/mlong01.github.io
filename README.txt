CORRECT/INCORRECT ASPECTS

	All my formatting seems to be able to handle windows of all sizes
	and reposition themselves accordingly, which is good. The files
	definitely have more shortcomings than good aspects, however.

	They did not pass all the html5 or the CSS tests. Unfortunately,
	by the time I was finished and able to check, it was 11:48 PM
	on the night it was due (and my comp 40 partner is currently sitting
	next to me incredibly patiently while I finish this). It yelled at
	me for how I handled div tags, id-ing the same tag more than once.

HELP

	I got some help from Tyler Lubeck in making me use git correctly,
	as my repositories were all over the place. I also consulted Google
	a lot for some CSS styling elements, but I feel as though that may
	be common practice.
